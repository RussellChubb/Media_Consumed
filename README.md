## 🎬 Movies

| Title | Rating | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Now You See Me: Now You Don't | C | First movie I watched in 2026 while my stomach was doing backflips in Bali. It's nowhere near as good as the first, or even the second one in this series, but it's still a pretty enjoyable use of a couple of hours. |
| Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowehere | C | Watched this during an 8+ hour layover at Sydney Airport. Thought it was fine—you might enjoy it more if you’re a die-hard Springsteen fan, but otherwise it’s okay. |
| Predator Badlands | B | Surprised at how much I enjoyed this, with my takeaway being that this film is everything that *Avatar: Fire and Ash* wanted to be, but wasn't... Would recommend. |
| Sisu | B | Enjoyed this one — probably not something I'd sit down with the missus to watch (*due to how gory it is*). I'd recommend it to her father to watch. Super solid movie. |
| Prisoners | B | Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors, so it's no surprise to see that he's cooked in this film. The film is full of good twists, gritty moments, all wrapped in a thrilling plot. |
| People You Meet on Vacation | C | I don't think I'm quite the target audience for this one, Olivia rated it a B. I think it's an alright way to kill a couple of hours in the evening |
| Train Dreams | A+ | Got reccomended this movie by a colleague at work. It's hard to find the words to describe this movie, it's a beautiful film about love, loss, life and the human spirit. Would reccomend to anyone. |
| Game Night | C+ | Watched this movie with a bowl of Ice Cream, not bad. |
| Reservoir Dogs | A | Didn't realise this was Tarantino's first film. Looks super nice, clearly done on a low budget, but it doesn't really show. Super enjoyable. |
| Nuremburg | A | Dark, Semi-Gritty, long ass movie though - Would reccomend |
| Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair | B | Really liked it, thought the conclusion was weak sauce. |
| The Rip | A | Enjoyed it! - Really liked the twist(s)! |
| Woman of the Hour | B | Yeah, pretty good - Side note, these descriptions seem to be getting shorter and shorter... |
| Marty Supreme | C | Felt like too much going on. |
| Skid Marks | C | I enjoy a stupid raunchy comedy from time to time... |
| Napolean Dynamite | C | Cult classic, wasn't a huge fan, but wasn't bad. |
| American Pie: Girls Rule | C | Yeah, not bad. This was Olivias pick and the hill she died on... |

| If Cats Disappeared from the World | B | Bought this book to get back into reading after taking a break for ~3 months. Its simple writing style makes for a low-friction way to consume, and the plot and underlying themes are incredibly poignant. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy-to-read, enjoyable book. |

| The Problem of the Green Capsule | *The Hollow Man* is a book referenced in *Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery*. When I went to research it, people (*someone in a Reddit thread*) recommended this instead. |
| The Invisible Man | This book was referenced in *Prisoners*. |
